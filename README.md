# NeuralMusic
NeuralMusic is a project for my Master's Thesis.

It is an implementation of a variational autoencoder that generate blues solos.

The VAE and its components are located in the neuralnetwork folder.
Preprocessed MIDI files needs to be added in a separate folder in the neuralnetwork folder for training. Change the path in vae.py to train.
